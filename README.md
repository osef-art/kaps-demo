### TIPS üí°

- Matches of **5 tiles or more** decrease passive sidekicks cooldowns by one.
- Matches of **5 tiles or more** give extra mana to sidekicks.
- Kill **viruses** first. They can easily make you lose control of a game.
- Don't forget to use that **HOLD** feature !
- The choice of **sidekicks** and their **synergy** can be decisive for some levels.
- Keep in mind that **square matches** (3x3) are worth a huge amount of mana !
- Struggling ? Consider farming **mana** and let your sidekicks give you a hand !
- The bigger the **matches**, the greater **damage** is inflicted to matched germs.
- Putting explosive capsules near **Thorns** is an excellent way to **trap them** !
